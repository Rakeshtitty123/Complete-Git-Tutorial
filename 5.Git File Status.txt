************************************************Git File Status LifeCycle*******************************************

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are mainly 4 stages for a git repo:

1.Untacked Stage

2.Unmodified stage

3.Modified stage

4.Staged Area

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.Untracked stage:

After intailsing the git through ($ git init command) a .git folder will be made.

This is an empty git folder.

Although we intialised a git repo for current working directory all the files were not added into the .git folder.

This stage of files is called as untracked stage as files are not tracked yet.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.Unmodified stage:

We will add all the files so that they can be tracked in the git folder through command:

$ git add --a

Now all the files were added into the .git folder and they were now being tarcked.

We didn't modified the files after they were being tracked.We added all the files as they were into the .gitfolder

This stage of files is called as unmodified stage of files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.Modified Stage:

After tracking(adding) files into git folder if we made any chnages to the files in our computer,the files in that stage are
called as Modified Stage.

We can see all the modifications through command:

 $ git status

-------------------------ðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿All the modified files will be in red textðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.Staged Area

As we made the changes in our file these modified files not yet tracked in the .git folder

To add the modified files into the .git folder:
 
$ git add MODIFIED_FILE_NAME
  
or 

You can track all the files again into the git folder using command:

$ git add --a

Now all the modified files are tracked into the .git folder and the git repo is up to date with all changes.

You can commit the changes through commit command:

$ git commit -m "Changes Commited"


You can review the git repo with git status command:

$ git status

--------------------ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ALL THE FILES WILL BE IN GREEN------------------------ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

This stage of files called as staged area.
